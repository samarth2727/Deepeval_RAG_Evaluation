            Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. It involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.
            
            There are three main types of machine learning:
            1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs
            2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples
            3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties
            
            Common applications include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
