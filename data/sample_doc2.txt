            Deep Learning and Neural Networks
            
            Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
            
            Key components of neural networks:
            - Neurons (nodes): Basic processing units
            - Layers: Input, hidden, and output layers
            - Weights and Biases: Parameters that determine the network's behavior
            - Activation Functions: Determine the output of neurons
            
            Deep learning has revolutionized fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.
